Implement Naive Rank Train with Naive Rank Test, or RankTrain with RankTest, or both, for movie ratings from the MovieLens education ml-latest-small (size: 1MB) dataset found at https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/. To augment this dataset, we have collected the plot summary (plots-imdb.csv, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lupQzmOlOHxWWTryHWmyxEDYT3JKoafP) and rating (ratings-imdb.csv, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Vs2q6e36Ea32pvbuMLy11fiUrqLnqiyK) available from IMDb for the movies in the MovieLens dataset. Evaluate each ranking using the Kemeny distance measure and focus only on the top 50 results, where the IMDb ratings are considered ground truth. For the Kemeny distance you will need to modify the original distance definition to use the average difference between the ranks of each movie. Each pair of movies should be represented as a feature vector containing their release years, and bag of words (Count Vectorizer) for each of their genres, titles and plots. Evaluate the results with and without each of the two text mining tools we discussed in class: stop word filtering, and word frequency-inverse document frequency instead of word counts.
